# CS340 database project
# Airworthiness Database

## Overview
The Airworthiness Database is a web application to enable tracking the records of aircraft which are registered with the FAA, and to help identify required maintenance that is mandated by Airworthiness Directives issued by the FAA. The user interface is designed to facilitate Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations to be carried out by the database administrator. The application is built with Flask, the python web framework, and is connected to a MySQL database.

## Features
- Maintain contact information for Aircraft Owners
- Create and revise information related to Aircraft Models and Aircraft registered with the FAA.
- Apply FAA-mandated maintenance requirements to Registered Aircraft
- Track maintenance records for Registered Aircraft
